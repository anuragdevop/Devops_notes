---

### **2. Infrastructure Provisioning Using Terraform**

- **Choosing the Cloud Platform:**
  - After assessing the application requirements, we chose AWS for its robust infrastructure and Azure for its integration with existing tools.

- **Writing Terraform Configuration Files:**
  - Terraform was used to automate infrastructure provisioning. The infrastructure code was stored in a version-controlled GitHub repository, enabling collaboration and tracking.

    **Terraform Configuration for AWS:**
    ```hcl
    provider "aws" {
      region = "us-west-2"
    }

    resource "aws_vpc" "main_vpc" {
      cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
    }

    resource "aws_subnet" "main_subnet" {
      vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main_vpc.id
      cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
    }

    resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
      ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
      subnet_id     = aws_subnet.main_subnet.id
      key_name      = "my-key-pair"
    }
    ```

    **Terraform Configuration for Azure:**
    ```hcl
    provider "azurerm" {
      features = {}
    }

    resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
      name     = "myResourceGroup"
      location = "East US"
    }

    resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
      name                = "myVNet"
      address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
      location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
      resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
    }

    resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
      name                 = "mySubnet"
      resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
      virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name
      address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
    }

    resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "vm" {
      name                  = "myVM"
      resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
      location              = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
      size                  = "Standard_DS1_v2"
      admin_username        = "adminuser"
      network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.main.id]
      admin_ssh_key {
        username   = "adminuser"
        public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
      }
      os_disk {
        caching              = "ReadWrite"
        storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"
      }
      source_image_reference {
        publisher = "Canonical"
        offer     = "UbuntuServer"
        sku       = "18.04-LTS"
        version   = "latest"
      }
    }
    ```

- **Applying Terraform Configuration:**
  - After writing the configurations, the next step was to apply them to create the infrastructure.

    **Commands:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    terraform plan -var-file="aws_config.tfvars"
    terraform apply -var-file="aws_config.tfvars"
    ```

    - The `terraform init` command initializes the working directory, installing necessary plugins.
    - `terraform plan` previews the changes that will be applied.
    - `terraform apply` creates the resources defined in the configuration.

---

### **3. Containerization with Docker**

- **Dockerizing Applications:**
  - Each microservice was containerized using Docker. Dockerfiles were created for each service, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

    **Sample Dockerfile:**
    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
    ```

- **Building Docker Images:**
  - After writing the Dockerfile, I built the Docker images and pushed them to a private Docker registry hosted on Nexus3.

    **Commands:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
    docker tag myapp:1.0 nexus3.example.com/repository/docker-releases/myapp:1.0
    docker push nexus3.example.com/repository/docker-releases/myapp:1.0
    ```

- **Collaboration with Developers:**
  - I worked closely with the development team to optimize Docker images for faster builds and smaller sizes. This involved minimizing the number of layers in the Dockerfile and using multi-stage builds.

---

### **4. Orchestrating with Kubernetes**

- **Kubernetes Cluster Setup:**
  - We used managed Kubernetes services—EKS on AWS and AKS on Azure—to orchestrate the deployment of Docker containers. Kubernetes manifests were written to define deployments, services, and ConfigMaps.

    **Kubernetes Deployment YAML:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: myapp-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: myapp
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: myapp
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: myapp-container
            image: nexus3.example.com/repository/docker-releases/myapp:1.0
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
    ```

- **Applying Kubernetes Manifests:**
  - The Kubernetes manifests were applied to deploy the application in the Kubernetes cluster.

    **Commands:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    kubectl describe deployment myapp-deployment
    ```

    - `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` applies the deployment configuration.
    - `kubectl get pods` lists all running pods and their status.
    - `kubectl describe deployment myapp-deployment` provides detailed information about the deployment, useful for debugging.

- **Setting Up Helm for Application Management:**
  - Helm charts were used to manage Kubernetes applications. I created Helm charts for easier and more consistent deployments across environments.

    **Helm Commands:**
    ```bash
    helm create myapp-chart
    helm install myapp-release ./myapp-chart
    helm list
    ```

---

### **5. Version Control and Branching Strategy**

- **GitHub Repository Setup:**
  - The codebase was stored in a GitHub repository. We followed the GitFlow branching strategy to manage features, releases, and hotfixes.

    **Commands:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/company/repo.git
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature
    git add .
    git commit -m "Implement new feature"
    git push origin feature/new-feature
    ```

- **Pull Requests and Code Reviews:**
  - Code was reviewed through pull requests (PRs) before merging into the `develop` branch. This process ensured code quality and facilitated team collaboration.

    **Creating a Pull Request:**
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git merge feature/new-feature
    git push origin develop
    ```

- **Integrating GitHub with Jenkins:**
  - GitHub was integrated with Jenkins to trigger the CI/CD pipeline automatically whenever a code change was pushed to the repository.

---

### **6. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins**

- **Setting Up Jenkins:**
  - Jenkins was set up on an EC2 instance. I configured the Jenkins server and installed necessary plugins, including Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, and SonarQube.

    **Commands:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
    sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key
    sudo yum install jenkins
    sudo systemctl start jenkins
    sudo systemctl status jenkins
    ```

- **Creating a Jenkins Pipeline:**
  - I created a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

    **Pipeline Configuration:**
    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any
        environment {
            DOCKER_CREDENTIALS

_ID = 'docker-hub-credentials'
            SONARQUBE_SERVER = 'sonarqube-server'
        }
        stages {
            stage('Checkout Code') {
                steps {
                    git branch: 'develop', url: 'https://github.com/company/repo.git'
                }
            }
            stage('Build with Maven') {
                steps {
                    sh 'mvn clean install'
                }
            }
            stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
                steps {
                    withSonarQubeEnv('sonarqube-server') {
                        sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
                    }
                }
            }
            stage('Build Docker Image') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        docker.build("nexus3.example.com/repository/docker-releases/myapp:${env.BUILD_ID}")
                    }
                }
            }
            stage('Push Docker Image') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        docker.withRegistry('https://nexus3.example.com', 'docker-hub-credentials') {
                            docker.image("nexus3.example.com/repository/docker-releases/myapp:${env.BUILD_ID}").push()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
                steps {
                    kubernetesDeploy(kubeconfigId: 'kubeconfig', configs: 'k8s/deployment.yaml')
                }
            }
        }
        post {
            always {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', allowEmptyArchive: true
            }
            success {
                echo 'Deployment Successful'
            }
            failure {
                echo 'Deployment Failed'
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Managing Build Artifacts:**
  - Maven was used to build the Java microservices, and the build artifacts were stored in Nexus3. Jenkins pipelines handled the entire process, from checking out code to deploying it on Kubernetes.

    **Maven Build Command:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

---

### **7. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**

- **Managing Infrastructure Changes:**
  - All infrastructure changes were managed using Terraform. The Terraform configurations were updated as the project evolved, ensuring that the infrastructure remained consistent across environments.

    **Applying Changes:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
    terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
    ```

- **State Management:**
  - Terraform state files were stored securely in S3 (for AWS) and Azure Blob Storage (for Azure). This allowed for collaborative management of the infrastructure.

    **State Management Commands:**
    ```bash
    terraform state list
    terraform state show aws_instance.web_server
    terraform state mv aws_instance.old_name aws_instance.new_name
    ```

---

### **8. Configuration Management with Ansible**

- **Automating Configuration Across Environments:**
  - Ansible was used to automate the configuration of servers. Playbooks were written to handle tasks like installing necessary software, configuring network settings, and ensuring security best practices.

    **Ansible Playbook Example:**
    ```yaml
    - hosts: web_servers
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Install Nginx
          apt:
            name: nginx
            state: present

        - name: Copy Nginx Configuration
          copy:
            src: /home/user/nginx.conf
            dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
            mode: '0644'
            owner: root
            group: root

        - name: Start Nginx Service
          systemd:
            name: nginx
            state: started
            enabled: yes
    ```

- **Running Playbooks:**
  - The playbooks were executed to configure the servers, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

    **Commands:**
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory/prod_hosts playbook.yml
    ansible all -m ping
    ```

- **Inventory Management:**
  - Ansible inventory files were used to manage the different environments. Each environment (development, staging, production) had its own inventory file, listing the servers and their respective roles.

    **Inventory File Example:**
    ```ini
    [web_servers]
    web1.example.com
    web2.example.com

    [db_servers]
    db1.example.com
    db2.example.com
    ```

---

### **9. Monitoring and Logging with Prometheus and Grafana**

- **Setting Up Prometheus for Monitoring:**
  - Prometheus was deployed on the Kubernetes cluster to monitor the health and performance of the applications. It was configured to scrape metrics from various sources, including the Kubernetes nodes, pods, and application endpoints.

    **Prometheus Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'kubernetes'
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
          - role: node
      - job_name: 'myapp'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:8080']
    ```

- **Deploying Grafana for Visualization:**
  - Grafana was integrated with Prometheus to visualize the collected metrics. I created dashboards for real-time monitoring of application performance, resource usage, and error rates.

    **Grafana Setup Commands:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name=grafana grafana/grafana
    ```

- **Creating Alerts:**
  - Alerts were set up in Grafana to notify the team in case of any critical issues. This ensured that any potential problems could be addressed promptly, minimizing downtime.

    **Alerting Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
    kind: PrometheusRule
    metadata:
      name: myapp-alerts
      labels:
        prometheus: myapp
    spec:
      groups:
      - name: myapp.rules
        rules:
        - alert: HighCPUUsage
          expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="default",container="myapp"}[5m])) by (pod) > 0.9
          for: 1m
          labels:
            severity: critical
          annotations:
            summary: "High CPU usage detected for pod {{ $labels.pod }}"
            description: "Pod {{ $labels.pod }} is using over 90% of CPU"
    ```

---

### **10. Automation and Scripting with Bash & Python**

- **Developing Automation Scripts:**
  - I wrote several automation scripts in Bash and Python to streamline routine tasks like backups, log rotation, and resource monitoring.

    **Bash Script for Backups:**
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    BACKUP_DIR="/backup"
    SOURCE_DIR="/data"
    DATE=$(date +%F)
    tar -czvf $BACKUP_DIR/$DATE-backup.tar.gz $SOURCE_DIR
    echo "Backup completed successfully."
    ```

    **Python Script for Disk Monitoring:**
    ```python
    import psutil

    def check_disk_usage():
        usage = psutil.disk_usage('/')
        if usage.percent > 80:
            print("Warning: Disk usage is above 80%")
        else:
            print("Disk usage is under control")

    check_disk_usage()
    ```

- **Scheduling Scripts with Cron:**
  - The Bash scripts were scheduled to run periodically using cron jobs, ensuring that backups and maintenance tasks were performed regularly.

    **Cron Job Setup:**
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

    **Cron Job Example:**
    ```bash
    0 2 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
    ```

- **Custom Monitoring and Reporting:**
  - The Python scripts were used for custom monitoring tasks, such as checking specific application logs or system metrics, and generating reports that were sent to the team via email.

---

### **11. Ticketing and Project Management with JIRA**

- **Managing Tasks in JIRA:**
  - All tasks and issues were tracked in JIRA. Each task was assigned to team members and prioritized according to the project requirements.

    **Creating a Task:**
    ```bash
    curl -u user:token -X POST --data '{"fields":{"project":{"key":"PROJ"},"summary":"New Task","description":"Task description","issuetype":{"name":"Task"}}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/
    ```

- **Sprint Planning and Tracking:**
  - We followed Agile methodology with two-week sprints. During sprint planning meetings, tasks were estimated and assigned, and their progress was tracked throughout the sprint using JIRA.

    **Tracking Task Progress:**
    ```bash
    curl -u user:token -X PUT --data '{"transition": {"id": "31"}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/ISSUE-1/transitions
    ```

- **Integrating JIRA with Jenkins and GitHub:**
  - JIRA was integrated with Jenkins and GitHub, enabling automatic updates of task statuses based on code commits and build statuses. This integration provided real-time visibility into the project’s progress for all stakeholders.

---

### **12. Artifact Management with Nexus3 & Azure Artifacts**

- **Storing Build Artifacts:**
  - All build artifacts, such as JAR files and Docker images, were stored in **Nexus3** and **Azure Artifacts**. This allowed for version control and easy retrieval of artifacts for deployments.

    **Uploading Artifacts to Nexus3:**
    ```bash
    mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=com.company -DartifactId=myapp -Dversion=1.0

 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=target/myapp-1.0.jar -DrepositoryId=nexus-releases -Durl=https://nexus3.example.com/repository/maven-releases/
    ```

    **Uploading Artifacts to Azure Artifacts:**
    ```bash
    az artifacts universal publish --organization https://dev.azure.com/yourorg --feed myfeed --name myapp --version 1.0.0 --path target/
    ```

---

### **13. Security Practices and Compliance**

- **Implementing Security Measures:**
  - Security was a top priority throughout the project. We implemented various security practices, such as using IAM roles for resource access, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and regularly patching servers.

    **Security Configurations:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: myapp-secret
    data:
      username: YWRtaW4=
      password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm
    ```

    **IAM Role Creation:**
    ```bash
    aws iam create-role --role-name myapp-role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
    aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name myapp-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
    ```

- **Compliance and Auditing:**
  - Compliance with industry standards was maintained through regular audits and automated compliance checks using tools like AWS Config and Azure Policy.

    **AWS Config Setup:**
    ```bash
    aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://config-rule.json
    ```

    **Azure Policy Assignment:**
    ```bash
    az policy assignment create --policy /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/{policyDefinitionName} --name 'audit-vms-without-managed-disks'
    ```

---

### **14. Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented**

- **Challenge:** Scaling the application to handle increased traffic.
  - **Solution:** Implemented auto-scaling policies in Kubernetes, enabling the application to automatically scale based on CPU and memory usage.

    **Auto-scaling Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
    metadata:
      name: myapp-hpa
    spec:
      scaleTargetRef:
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        name: myapp-deployment
      minReplicas: 2
      maxReplicas: 10
      metrics:
      - type: Resource
        resource:
          name: cpu
          target:
            type: Utilization
            averageUtilization: 80
    ```

- **Challenge:** Ensuring zero downtime during deployments.
  - **Solution:** Used Kubernetes rolling updates and Canary deployments to gradually update the application while monitoring its performance.

    **Rolling Update Strategy:**
    ```yaml
    spec:
      strategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
        rollingUpdate:
          maxUnavailable: 1
          maxSurge: 1
    ```

- **Challenge:** Securing sensitive information in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Solution:** Used Jenkins credentials plugin to securely manage and inject sensitive information like API keys and passwords into the pipeline.

    **Credential Injection in Jenkins:**
    ```groovy
    withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'nexus-password', variable: 'NEXUS_PASSWORD')]) {
        sh 'curl -u admin:$NEXUS_PASSWORD https://nexus3.example.com/repository/maven-releases/'
    }
    ```
